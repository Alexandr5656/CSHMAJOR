<h1>CSH MajorProject Robot "PleaseWork"</h1>
<p>I got the idea when someone brought up having a seminar on making robots but it was considered hard since people couldnt come to floor to have time with the robot and people wouldnt have
access to the same kits without spending money. This way people can program the same robot over a distance. After i finished and was talking with my roommate i also realized 
that this could be used just to program any Raspberry Pi project in general over a distance for a classroom setting.</p>
